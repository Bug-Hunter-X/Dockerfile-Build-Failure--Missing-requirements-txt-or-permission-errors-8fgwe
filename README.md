This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: failure to build due to a missing or inaccessible `requirements.txt` file, or insufficient permissions. The `Dockerfile` attempts to install Python dependencies using `pip3`, but this will fail if `requirements.txt` is absent or inaccessible.  Additionally, permission issues can prevent the installation of packages. This improved `Dockerfile_solution` addresses these problems by including a sample `requirements.txt` and ensuring correct ownership and permissions for the build process.
